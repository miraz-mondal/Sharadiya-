Sharadiya is a wholesome website for festive season currently it is on Durga Puja mainly designed for specially abled people who are unable to come to places it is designed for them to get the full experience of the festive season. Also to the people who are unable to come to their hometown for festive season, Sharadiya is designed for them <3

Key points :
* This is a minor project made for an Industrial training.
* It helps to understand about the fundamentals of PHP and environment of a Full Stack Website. And the use of javascript and logic building to perform user interaction on web page.
* This type of webapp, specially the functionalities teaches a lot. You can be familier with Positioning of elements and responsive UI after this type of projects.
* It is strongly recomended to build a very small project, before moving on this type of preojects.
* This type of projects gives you exposure to express your creativity. You can experiment with the UI and funcionalities.
* This projects makes you understand the usage and USP of a full stack production level webapp.

<!-- This project helped us to learn about many things, like we had to figure out a unique project around the internet. There is no webaap with this idea having all these functionalities all togather. Like most of the game don't have the feature to play with player names. If they have somehow, there will not be a option to reset the round. Along with that no one added rounds in a tic tac toe game. So we tried to implement this all togather. :smile: -->

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Sharadiya is designed for elderlies and for thoes people who are out of their hometown and cannot attend the festive season. This is a one stop solution for them. Three types of users are there. One type of user who can read the content, watch a video, and explore the services menu also can apply to the job that is present on the web application. The other two users are content creator users and employer users, both are self-explanatory they can create content regarding Bengali's biggest festival Durga Puja and post it there. The other employer user can list as many services as he or want so he/she can hire the right guy for the job. They both need to sign up then they can enter the main section where these operations are being taken place through PHP and MySQL servers. Other than that the web application also has a blog section where one can see content and this web application is fully responsive. This application also has a admin-panel which is there to see the MySQL rows without running the MySQL server.


<!-- It is a fun projects and a really cool game with uh! impressive UI I guess! So you can use it to show off your strategic skill to your friend. Or you can use it for a litle timepass. Have fun!
