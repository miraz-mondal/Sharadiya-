## Usage

- Sharadiya is designed for elderly and for thoes people who are out of their hometown and cannot attend the festive season. This is a one stop solution for them.

- Three types of users are present. One type of user who can read the content, watch a video, and explore the services menu also can apply to the job that is present on the Sharadiya.

- The other two users are content creator and employer, both are self-explanatory they can create content regarding Bengali's biggest festival Durga Puja and post it there and employer user can list as many services as he or want so he/she can hire the right guy for the job.

- They both need to sign up then they can enter the main section where these operations are being taken place through PHP and MySQL server.

- Other than that the Sharadiya also has a blog section where one can see content and it is fully responsive.

- This application also has a admin-panel which is there to see the MySQL rows without running the MySQL server.
